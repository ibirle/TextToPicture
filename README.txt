Look in the Picture folder to see the results!

Intro:
	This project was made as a project for a high school english class. I wanted to combines important pieces of text from the class with symbolic images. I went about this using my python skills and a programming tool set called processing that is great for image manipulation. Since the end result was just the pictures I never made it user friendly and code has to be manually changed to produced each different picture
	
Skills Exhibited:
-Python
-Processing
-Image manipulation

How It Works:
	It first takes the source image and turns it black and white. Next it takes the input picture and separates it into even boxes each the size of one character of the font. It then goes through each box and sees if it is more of less than 50% black. If it is more it prints a character in that box. If it is less it paints it over white. Variables can be changed to make it inverted colors or change the size of the font.
